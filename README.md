# PiTrezor

STL files for a PiTrezor Wallet. Instructions for assembling and software can be found at https://www.pitrezor.com/2021/ (not mine).

For the Hat, use this: https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/displays/1.3inch-oled-hat.htm

Remove the directional control and middle button.

Shorten the pins you solder to your Pi Zero so that the only thing separating the Pi from the Hat is the pin receivers on the hat. It has to be that slim for the case to fit.

After that, first put the Pi into the base of the case. Then put a spacer on each of the pegs. Then add the hat to the pi.
Then, flip the whole assembly so far over. Flip the face plate over, add the buttons. Then, keeping the faceplate face down to ensure the buttons don't fall out, bring the faceplate togehter with the rest of the assembly.
